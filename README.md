# Trans-SEC Project - Tanzania Food and Land Productivity Information System

This Web-GIS project was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and realized in the framework of the Trans-SEC project (2013-2017, http://project2.zalf.de/trans-sec/public/) by a cooperation between Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), Morogoro, Tanzania and University of Hohenheim (UH), Stuttgart, Germany under support of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).

The online version ofthe web GIS tools developed 2014-2017 is hosted on a Server at Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), Morogoro, Tanzania http://sua.terragis.net/transsec .

A mirror of the SUA Server is at http://transsec.terragis.net or http://tsec.terragis.net (same server).

This site supplies a link to a [VirtualBox](https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FVirtualBox) image of the system that can run locally without the necessity of having an internet connection in order to run the tools in a browser. See the PDF help file in this repository for informationon [how to use that image](help_using_tsec_virtualbox_image.pdf). The project is aimed at providing a tool that can be used in the field in remote areas with no or slow internet connections and at providing interactive tools that can be used in teaching at in academic institutions and for capacity building. The virtual image is based on the OSGEO live project and is running on a Lubuntu operating system.

Download the zipped vdi file - size is a wooping 6.6 GB - for use with VirtualBox here: http://www.terragis.net/docs/other/tsec32_v1.0.zip . The unzipped image tsec32_v1.0.vdi is 20GB big  can then be used to start a virtual machine (based on 32 bit) inside your local installation of the [virtual box software](https://www.virtualbox.org).
